## üéØ Quick Comparison Test

### Method 1: Browser Zoom Comparison
1. Open site at 100% zoom with fix enabled
2. Take screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4)
3. Set browser zoom to 75% with fix disabled
4. Take screenshot
5. Compare: Should look nearly identical

### Method 2: Toggle Test
1. Open `/client/src/App.tsx`
2. Set `ENABLE_SCALE_FIX = false`
3. Refresh browser at 100% zoom
4. Note: Site should look oversized/zoomed-in
5. Set `ENABLE_SCALE_FIX = true`
6. Refresh browser
7. Note: Site should look correct

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

The fix is successful if:
1. ‚úì Site looks the same at 100% zoom (with fix) as it did at 75% zoom (without fix)
2. ‚úì No horizontal scrolling on laptop screens
3. ‚úì All interactive elements clickable with correct hit areas
4. ‚úì Browser zoom (Cmd +/-) still functions
5. ‚úì Mobile devices show original responsive layout (no scaling)
6. ‚úì No visual glitches (blurring, pixelation, overlaps)
7. ‚úì Performance smooth (no lag from transform)

## üì∏ Screenshot Locations for Documentation

Save screenshots to document the fix:
- `before-fix-100-zoom.png` (oversized layout)
- `after-fix-100-zoom.png` (correct layout)
- `mobile-view.png` (unchanged mobile layout)
- `about-us-page.png` (verify /about route)

## üö® Rollback Plan

If any issues occur:
1. Open `/client/src/App.tsx`
2. Change `const ENABLE_SCALE_FIX = true;` to `false`
3. Refresh browser
4. Original oversized layout will return
5. Report issue with specific browser/screen size details
